# Hotel-Service-Application-Guest
This mobile application was developed using Java on Android Studio.
This mobile application was created as a final year project for my Computer Science degree at Liverpool John Moores University. It was developed using the Java programming language on Android Studio and Google's Firebase was used for data communication between two individual applications which involved the guest and admin app.

Additionally, to test out this application you will need to clone both the guest and admin applications to see that both individual applications can send messages from one side to the other.
